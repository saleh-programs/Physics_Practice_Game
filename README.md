# Physics_Practice_Game
A game to help you improve at solving kinematics problems! Join Willow on a journeyâ€”gliding through the air, sprinting on foot, and maybe even chat with him if you do well enough!

# Try it yourself:
1) https://github.com/saleh-programs/Physics_Practice_Game > Code > Download ZIP.
2) Unzip the folder.
3) Run PhysicsPracticeGame.exe

# What's it about?
It's a lightweight educational game made of 10 levels that progressively increase in difficulty. Solve questions by typing your answers and pressing the enter key.

# NOTE:
When speaking to Willow in level 10, you must wait 50 seconds for him to respond the first time. This is because the website that hosts the server can go to sleep if inactive for 15 minutes, and therefore there is an initial delay. (I am using a free tier).
